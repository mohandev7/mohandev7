Hi there! 👋

I’m Mohan, a computer science engineering student based in India. I like building practical full-stack applications, working on scalable backend logic, and keeping systems clean, efficient, and maintainable.

These days I’m focused on:

* Java, JavaScript, MERN stack
* Data structures, backend APIs, real-time communication systems
* Small, production-style projects with solid architecture

Some stuff I built:

* SigmaGPT — An AI conversational assistant with contextual responses, chat history management, and secure API routing
* ApnaMeet — A real-time video conferencing platform with video/audio calls, screen sharing, live chat, and authenticated rooms
* InvestPro — A stock trading simulator featuring REST-based trade execution, portfolio tracking, and analytics dashboards
* Hospital Management System — A Java + JDBC application managing patients, doctors, and appointments through database operations
* Algorithm Practice — Java implementations covering sliding window, matrix problems, and core DSA patterns

Fun Facts:

* I don’t like coffee or tea ☕
* MS Dhoni is my favorite cricket player 🏏
* Hobbies: Watching podcasts and playing outdoor games
